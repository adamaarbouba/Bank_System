Currently, this is an app that simulates a bank login screen and includes only a deposit function, with a maximum deposit limit of $100.

Make sure to run these commands in the "Bank_System" directory:

make         # Builds the app in app/
make run     # Builds and runs the app
make clean   # Removes .o object files
make fclean  # Removes object files and the app/ directory
make re      # Fully rebuilds the entire project
